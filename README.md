league of legends champion select screen helper add-on that lets you instantly see your teammates’ stats (even in anonymous ranked queues).

how does it work?
the moment you enter champion select, the add-on activates automatically. it detects players’ hidden names (via puuid) in the lobby and shows you a detailed report.

key features:

* see hidden names: lists your teammates’ real summoner names and tags, even in anonymous queues (like soloq).
* detailed stats: instantly shows players’ win rates (wr), most played roles, kda ratios, and ranks.
* premade detection: analyzes whether players on your team have played together before (premade check).
* quick links: one-click links to sites like op.gg or porofessor.
* chat integration: optionally sends this info as an automatic message to the lobby chat.
* counter pick guide: provides analysis and suggestions for the best champion picks based on the enemy team.

in short: a professional analysis tool that lets you know who you’re playing with during champ select and helps boost your chances of winning.
